# End-to-End Secure Network Implementation Webapp

A web application to deploy, simulate, and document secure network services (DNS, DHCP, FTP, SSH) and attack scenarios. This project is designed for educational and lab purposes to demonstrate network security concepts, analyze attacks, and generate comprehensive reports.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Service Setup**: Document and configure lab services (DNS, DHCP, FTP, SSH).  
- **Attack Simulation**: Simulate common network attacks (ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, DHCP starvation, FTP/SSH brute-force).  
- **Artifact Upload**: Upload logs, PCAP files, screenshots, and other evidence.  
- **Automated Analysis**: Analyze uploaded artifacts and summarize findings.  
- **Dashboard**: Visual representation of lab status, attack results, and network activity.  
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generate detailed PDF reports including methodology, findings, and recommendations.  
- **No Login Required**: Open-access webapp for easy use in educational labs.

💡 Notes
All attacks and simulations should be run in a safe, isolated lab environment.

Do not perform any attacks on public networks.

If you want, I can also **add badges, commands, and a table of contents** to make the README look more professional and GitHub-ready.  

Do you want me to do that?
